<h1 id="#">Installation and Configuration</h1>
            <p>Luckily, installation is rather easy. Server owners can go <a href="index.html#Install">here</a>, click the links provided, follow the onscreen instructions and done! Just like that. </p>
            <p>So why do I have two bots?</p>
            <p>Albedo was first designed to be an entertainment bot, however as time passed and server owners requested more features this bot slowly became both a social bot and a utility bot.</p>
            <p>The social elements to Albedo do not require setting up, most of these will be pre-set by the Bot Owner (me) and require little to no tweaking. This page will instead detail and outline how to properly set up the utility and security related features that Albedo allows Admins to use. Modules will be listed in Alphabetical order since there is no set way that things should be set up. If at any time you are unable to follow the instructions or you have run into a problem not listed here use the<a href="https://discord.gg/dRrsA7Q"> support server</a> or contact the bot owner directly.</p>

            <h2 id="#Antilink">Antilink</h2>
            <p>This module allows you to prevent normal users from posting Discord Link to other servers. This is useful in scenarios where you want to allow links being posted but you don't allow server advertising. The settings allow you to toggle the feature on/off, toggle whether users get sent a private message when their post is deleted as well as setting the message that's sent.</p>
            <p>By default the toggle and toggledm options are set to false. This means you'll have to manually turn them on if you wish to use this feature.</p>
            <h2 id="Level">Level</h2>
            <p>Like most bots Albedo has her own internal levelling system. Here you can set the rate that users level up and whether they earn ranks reaching certain levels. The SC (Sever Config), CC (Channel Config) and LC (Level Config) are all tools to help set up how you want your server to work.</p>
            <h4 id="SC (Sever Config)">SC (Sever Config)</h4>
            <p>The Server Configuration options allow you to control global variables for your entire discord server. By default this feature is off , so to allow members to level up you'll need to use the toggle command (e.g. Albedo SC toggle). However it's recommend this be done after you have finished setting things up.</p>
            <p>The severEXP sub-command allows you to set up how much XP is gained per message. By default it's set to 1. It is recommended that you set this value in such a way that reaching the highest level takes a fair amount of time, giving users an incentive to stay active.</p>
            <p>The serverCD is used to help prevent users from spamming. This value is set to 60 seconds by default and has a lower custom limit of 5 seconds to prevent abuse.</p>
            <p>The ranktoggle command is provided so that admins can assign whether certain roles are kept when reaching the next level. By default all roles are set to True, so that when a user levels up they they existing roles. However you may not want that, for example Level 2 giving users the role Copper and Level 3 awarding Silver. In this scenario both the Copper and Silver roles would be toggled to False so that a level up would remove the old role and add the new one, instead of having both Copper and Silver. Of course this is up to the Server Owners discretion.</p>
            <h4 id="CC (Channel Config)">CC (Channel Config)</h4>
            <p>Similar to the SC group the Channel Configuration commands allows you to specify unique settings for individual channels. Of course the same limits apply here that the SC commands imposed. The channelCD and channelEXP commands work exactly like their server counterparts.</p>
            <p>The cp command is used to determine whether you want to give the channel unique settings. By default it's set to False. </p>
            <p>The togglechannel command will enable or disable the channel, allowing or preventing the gain of exp. This requries the cp command to be set to True and is on by default.</p>
            <h4 id="LC (Level Config)">LC (Level Config)</h4>
            <p>The Level configuration commands are simple and easy to use. They allow you to specify the xp needed to reach a level as well as the rank that is earned at certain levels. There are 100 levels that can be used, anything more is blocked by the bot.</p>
            <p>The getlevel command  allows you to see the current configuration for the input level. Showing XP needed and Rank (role) gained.</p>
            <p>The rank command allows you to specify what rank is gained at certain levels. By default this is set to None but valid Discord Roles can be used. Note, be careful to update this command when roles are renamed or deleted.</p>
            <p>The xp command allows you to determine the xp needed to reach a certain level. When using this command the bot should prevent admins from setting an xp amount lower than the previous level.</p>
            <h4 id="Other Commands">Other Commands</h4>
            <p>The P2W command allows users to quickly level up without waiting for the cooldown. This command will only work if the user's level is incorrect based on the current XP. </p>
            <p>The addXP, removeXP, setXP commands allows admins and mods to modify the XP values of users. The setLevel command works in the same way.</p>
            <p>The updateroles command should only be used in case of errors. If a problem persists afterwards please contact the bot owner.</p>
            <h2 id="Logset">Logset</h2>
            <p>This module allows you to log changes on your server. The following can currently be logged:</p>
            <p>- Deleted Messages<br>
              - Edited Messages<br>
              - Role Changes
            </p>
            <p>By default the log settings are turned off and need to be turned on with their respective toggle commands (e.g. Albedo logset deleteToggle). With all the log options the bot will require that a channel be specified first for logging.</p>
            <h2 id="MassDM">MassDM</h2>
            <p>This module allows you to send a message to all members, with various options to specify who get's send a message and even customise the messages themselves. (Note, this should only be used sparingly as most people will see it as annoying.)</p>
            <h2 id="Mass Move">Mass Move</h2>
            <p>This module allows you to move people from one voice chat to another, although there are only a few reasons why you'd need to do this it can help when VC is really active.</p>
            <h2 id="Mod">Mod</h2>
            <p>The commands in this module are mostly self-explanatory and are part of the standard tools to help moderators and admins keep the server in order. Note, many of these commands require that the bot has the correct permisions otherwise an error message will appear.</p>
            <h2 id="Punish">Punish</h2>
            <p>This module was designed to help admins and moderators keep a channel in order. These are tools which help punish, keep track of punishments and prevent trolls from excessively breaking the rules. However it's important to note that these tools are not autonomous (at least not yet), it'll take good Moderators and Admins to help enforce your rules.</p>
            <h4>Punish</h4>
            <p>The punish command takes a user and gives them a special role that 'punishes them'. In this state they won't be able to access general channels, enter Voice Chat or use commands. A punishment can be set with a corresponding time (e.g. 5m = 5 minutes or 10d = 10 days.). A reason can also be supplied which is sent to the punished user.</p>
            <h4 id="CPunish">CPunish</h4>
            <p>This command is similar to the punish command, however it has the added ability of deleting the last couple of messages that the punished user entered. This makes it useful to effeciently remove content that is not appropriate for your server.</p>
            <h4>UnPunish</h4>
            <p>This command works as the name suggests, unpunishing the user. This will remove the 'Punished' role and allow them to act as a normal user again.</p>
            <h4 id="LsPunish">LsPunish</h4>
            <p>This command allows mods and admins to see a list of users who are being punished, the length of time they have left, the user who punished them and the reason (if one was left).</p>
            <h4 id="Warn">Warn</h4>
            <p>This command allows mods and admins to warn users who believe that the offending user didn't do anything bad enough to warrant a punish but wants to officially tell them off anyway. Can be sent with or without a reason.</p>
            <h4 id="Punishset (Punish Settings)">Punishset (Punish Settings)</h4>
            <p>Albedo allows Admins to set up a (or multiple) logging channels to keep records of all punishments on the server, similar to the logging tools mentioned above. Every time a new user is punished the channel will update (provided the bot has the right channel permissions).</p>
            <h2 id="Roles">Roles</h2>
            <p>Roles are a fun way to allow users to immerse themselves with the Discord community. The roles module has tools to allow all users to try and assign themselves any valid role. Admins can set which roles are assignable using the 'toggleAssign' command as well as making certain roles exclusive, preventing a user from adding two or more roles (of a certain type) when they are only allowed one. The update roles command should only be used when there are error messages and if even this doesn't fix the issue please contact the bot owner.</p>
            <p>Note, it's important to make sure that users cannot give themselves roles with advanced permissions. This may result in severe misuse of the server, though ultimately the server owner can still put an end to that situation.</p>
            <h2 id="Welcome">Welcome</h2>
            <p>Who doesn't like a nice welcome? The Welcome module allows admins to determine how new users are greeted when joining the server as well as any messages that are set when they leave. The messages are customizable and allow admins to enter user mentions, channel mentions and more. By default this is turned off.</p>
            <h4 id="Lockdown">Lockdown</h4>
            <p>The lockdown command is an anti-troll prevention system that allows admins and mods to prevent mass trolls from entering and distrubing the servers current enviroment. This works in tandem with the welcome system that allows for users to gain a role when joining the server. When the lockdown command is initiated all new users will gain any roles that are currently set to be added as well as the lockdown role which acts like a 'Punishment' and prevents those members from using normal features.</p>
            <p>This state will persist no matter how many times the user leaves and joins, the welcome/leave messages also rerouting to the 'lockdown' channel (example name) to prevent spam in general/public channels.</p>
            <p>New to this command is the watch feature as well as the watch settings. This allows an admin to keep track of users who join for a set amount of time. By default it's set to 30 minutes. If a lockdown is initialed any watched members will also be pulled into lockdown in a bid to catch potential trolls.</p>
            <p>After that it's up to the admin/mods to use their best judgement on the situation.</p>
